        "\n",
        "The analysis of variance (ANOVA) can be thought of as an extension to the _t_ -test. The independent _t_ -test is used to compare the means of a condition between 2 groups. ANOVA is used when one wants to compare the means of a condition between 2+ groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "ANOVA is an **_omnibus test_**, meaning it tests the data as a whole. Another way to say that is this, ANOVA tests if there is a difference in the mean somewhere in the model (testing if there was an overall effect), but it does not tell one where the difference is if the there is one. To find out where the difference is between the groups, one has to conduct _post-hoc_ tests. This is also covered in this assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although it can be thought of as an extension of the _t_ -test, in terms of when to use it, mathematically speaking, it’s more of a regression model and is considered a generalized linear model (GLM). The general regression equation is as follow:\n",

However, with real world data, that is often not the case and one will have to make corrections to the data. If these assumptions are not met, and one does not want to transform the data, an alternative test that could be used is the Kruskal-Wallis H-test or Welch’s ANOVA."
