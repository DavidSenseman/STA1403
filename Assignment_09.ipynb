    "In this lesson you will learn how to use Python to perform simple and multiple linear regressions. In a previous assignment we discussed how to test a hypothesis regarding the relationship betweeen a binary explanatory variable and a numerical response variable using a two-sample _t_-test. We also discussed situations where we investigate the linear relationship between two numerical variables (e.g., percent body fat and abdomen circumference). In this case, we typically consider one of the two numerical variables (e.g., percent body fat) as the response (or target) variable and the other one (e.g., abdomen circumference) as the explanatory variable. The common theme for both methods is that we investigate the relationship between an explanatory variable (either categorical or numerical) and a numerical random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we discuss an alternative approach for analyzing such problems. This approach use linear regression models for either testing a hypothesis regarding the relationship between one or more explanatory variables and a response variable, or predicting unknown values of the response variable using one or more predictors. Note that we use the terms “explanatory variables” and “predictors” to distinguish the role of variables (other than the response variable) in the model.\n"

    "### Example 1: Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the cell below uses the Statsmodel `OLS()` function to perform a simple linear regression. The function `OLS()` stands for **_Ordinary Linear Squares_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is a fundamental technique in linear regression analysis used to estimate the parameters of a linear model. OLS aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) through a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences (residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts**\n",
    "1. _Linear Regression Model:_ The model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable ( y ) and one or more independent variables ( X ). The general form is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $     y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where ($ \\beta_0$ ) is the intercept, ( $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_n$ ) are the coefficients, and ( $ \\epsilon $ ) is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Residuals:_ The differences between the observed values ($ y_i $ ) and the predicted values ( $\\hat{y}_i $). Residuals are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ \\epsilon_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i  $ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Objective:_ Minimize the sum of the squared residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ \\text{Minimize} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Minimize Squared Residuals?\n",
    "Minimizing the squared residuals ensures that the model is as close as possible to the actual data points, reducing the overall error. Squaring the residuals also penalizes larger errors more heavily, leading to a more accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties of OLS**\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Unbiased Estimates:_ Under certain conditions (e.g., linearity, independence, homoscedasticity), OLS provides unbiased estimates of the coefficients.\n",
    "* _Efficiency:_ OLS estimates have the smallest variance among all unbiased linear estimators (Gauss-Markov theorem).\n",
    "* _Simplicity:_ The method is computationally straightforward and widely used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 1, we are asking whether differences in maternal age are associated with differences in birthweight. In other words, do the babies of older mothers weight more, or less, than the babies of younger mothers? In this situation, the mother's age is the **independent variable** and by convention, we assign it to the letter `X`. The baby's weight is the **dependent variable**, and we assign it to the letter `y`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We generate what is known as a **linear model** called `model_Eg1` using this line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `model_Eg1 = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()`\n",
    "\n",
