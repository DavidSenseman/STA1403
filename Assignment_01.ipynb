    "* **Collaborative Environment:** Colab notebooks are stored in Google Drive, making it easy to share and collaborate with others in real-time.\n",
    "* **Integration with Google Drive:** You can easily import and export data from your Google Drive, making data management straightforward.\n",
    "* **Rich Text and Code Cells:** Colab allows you to combine executable code with rich text, including images, HTML, LaTeX, and more, in a single document.\n",
    "* **Support for Popular Libraries:** Colab supports many popular Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "* **Interactive Visualizations:** You can create interactive visualizations directly within your notebook, enhancing your data analysis and presentation.\n",
    "* **Easy Sharing and Collaboration:** You can share your notebooks with others, allowing them to comment or even edit them, facilitating teamwork and collaboration.\n",
