    "## Overview of COLAB \n",
    "\n",
    "Google COLAB was designed to be similar to a **Jupyter Lab** notebook. Jupyter is a large umbrella project that covers many different software offerings and tools, including the popular [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web-based notebook authoring and editing applications. The Jupyter project and its subprojects all center around providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course the main pedagogical (teaching) tool for teaching **Python** coding will be the Google COLAB notebook. In this course you will be assigned a number of COLAB notebook's as **_Assignments**. This particular COLAB notebook is **Assignment_01**. All coding assignments are **_optional_**. You decide not to complete any Python coding assignment, this will **not** affect your course grade! If you do decide to complete one (or more) coding assignments, you will be awarded up to 5 Bonus Points for each assignment completed. There are a total of 10 assignments so you can improve your course grade by a maximum of 50 Bounus Points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each assignment explains a different aspect of writing computer code in **Python** and using **Python** to solve statistical problems using biological and medical datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a COLAB Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this assignment is to make you familiar with the Google COLAB interface. The visual interface for a COLAB notebook is shown in the following image:\n",

    "\n",
    "A notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. JupyterLab notebook provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others."
