    "Very often we are specifically interested in population mean and population variance of a random variable. These quantities are unknown in general. We\n",
    "refer to these unknown quantities as **parameters**. Here, we use parameters μ and σ<sup>2</sup> to denote the unknown population mean and variance respectively. Note that for all the distributions we discussed in the previous chapter, the population mean and variance of a random variable are related to the unknown parameters of probability distribution assumed for that random variable. Indeed, for normal distributions _N_(μ,σ<sup>2</sup>), which are widely used in statistics, the population mean and variance are exactly the same parameters used to specify the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Aasignment, we discuss statistical methods for parameter **estimation**. Estimation refers to the process of guessing the unknown value of a parameter (e.g., population mean) using the observed data. For this, we will use an **estimator**, which is a **statistic**. A statistic is a function of the observed data only. That is, it does not depend on any unknown parameter, and given the observed data, we should be able to find its value. For example, the **_sample_mean_** is the statistic that is used to estimate the **_population_mean_**. Given a sample of data, we can find the sample mean by adding the observed values and dividing the result by the sample size. No unknown parameter is involved in this process."

As a result, similar to any other random variable, we can talk about their probability distribution. Probability distributions for estimators are called **sampling distributions**.

Therefore we have used the word `mu` to represent the Greek symbol for the mean, μ. \n",

We also need a variable called `numMeans` to specify the total number of samples we want to include in our sample distribution. In this example, `numMeans` is set to 1000.\n",
