    "## **Introduction to Hypothsis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing biomedical experiments, it is typical to start by expressing a **_hypothesis_** to explain an observed phenomenon. For example, Mackowiak _et al_. (1992) measured the body temperature of a number of healthy men and women and found that the average of their body temperatures were less than the normally accepted value of 98.6°F. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this observation, they hypothesized that value of 98.6 <sup>o</sup>F reported by the great German physician, Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich in 1856 (see photograph) was too high and that the real value was somewhat lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "![__](https://biologicslab.co/STA1403/images/A06/Wunderlich.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we look at **_hypothesis testing_** as a formal way to statistically compare two (or more) sets of numerical values. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in many areas of mathematics and statistics, certain Greek letters and/or symbols are commonly used in specific types of problems. In statistics, for example, the lower case Greek letter mu ( **_μ_** ) is used to represent the **_population mean_** of a variable being studied. In this example, the variable is body temperature. Using this notation we can express Mackowiak _et al_'s hypothesis as _μ_ < 98.6 <sup>o</sup>F. \n",
    "\n",
    "For many students, the next step is the hardest since it seems to be opposite of what you want to show. The trick is that you have to find another explanation, also expressed as a hypothesis, that **_invalidates_** (annuls) your proposed hypothesis. We call this hypothesis the **_null hypothesis_** and denote it as  **_H<sub>0</sub>_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The _null hypothesis_ usually reflects the “status quo” or “nothing of interest”. In this example the _status quo_ would simply be the old value reported by Dr. Wunderlich of 98.6 <sup>o</sup>F. Imagine trying to win a blue ribbon at a high school science fair if all your project showed was that normal body temperature was the good old 98.6 <sup>o</sup>F? In other words, proving a **_null hypothesis_** would definitely be considered “<u>nothing of interest</u>” and not likely to make you famous, or win any prize at a science fair for that matter.     \n",
    "\n",
    "But now look at this situation the other way around. What if you could **_prove_** that the great Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich had been **_wrong_** all these years and that, because of your brilliant research, the true body temperature was **_not_** 98.6 <sup>o</sup>F after all? In that case, you (and everyone else) would have to **_reject the null hypothesis_**. And more importantly, if the null hypothesis is rejected, you (and everyone else) would now be **_forced_** to accept **YOUR** hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call your hypothesis--the hypothesis that you are investigating--the **_alternative hypothesis_** and we denote it as **_H<sub>A</sub>_**. When you are able to disprove (i.e. **_reject_**) the null hypothesis, _H<sub>0</sub>_, it means you have to accept the alternative hypothesis, _H<sub>A</sub>_, as being true.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------\n",
    "#### **The Secret of Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **_secret of hypothesis testing_** is that the only way to show that your hypothesis (the alternative hypothesis **_H<sub>A</sub>_**) is correct, is to **_prove_** the null hypothesis (**_H<sub>0</sub>_**) is **_wrong_**. When you **reject** the null hypothesis, you are logically forced to accept the alternative hypothesis as being true since it is the only possible alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will return to the topic of hypothesis testing latter in this lesson. Before we are ready, we need to learn: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to **_read_** data files stored locally on your computer\n",
    "2. How to create a **_dataframe_** to store the data in a convient format\n",
    "3. How to **_extract specific data_** from dataframes using **_Boolean Masks_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, Mackowiak _et al_ hypothesized the widely accepted value of 98.6 <sup>o</sup>F was wrong due to long-standing error made by the Germany physiologist, Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich. Instead,  and that true mean body temperature _μ_ ≥ 98.6. We refer to this hypothesis as the **_null hypothesis_** and denote it as _H<sub>0</sub>_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis usually reflects the “status quo” or “nothing of interest”. In contrast, we refer to our hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis we are investigating through a scientific study) as the **_alternative hypothesis_** and denote it as _H<sub>A</sub>_. It is common to express the null hypothesis in the simplest form possible. For the above example, to annul the alternative hypothesis, _H<sub>A</sub>_ : _μ_ < 98.6, it suffices to show that _H<sub>0</sub>_ : _μ_ = 98.6. This makes the task of evaluating a hypothesis easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure for evaluating a hypothesis is called **_hypothesis testing_** and it rises in many scientific problems. A common approach for hypothesis testing is to focus on the null hypothesis, which is usually simpler than the alternative hypothesis, and decide whether or not to reject it. To this end, we examine the evidence that the observed data provide against the null hypothesis _H<sub>0</sub>_. If the evidence against _H<sub>0</sub>_ is strong, we **_reject_** _H<sub>0</sub>_. If not, we state that the evidence provided by the data is not strong enough to reject _H<sub>0</sub>_, and we **_fail to reject it_**.\n"

Then we consider **_both_** large positive values and small negative values of the population mean as evidence against the null hypothesis, and our alternative hypothesis is referred to as **_two-sided_**.\n",

    "As mentioned in an earlier lesson, a data file stored on your computer is considered a data type known as a **_stream_**. Python has a relative large number of ways to read different types of data streams depending on the size of the data and the type of data connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the datafile is stored locally on a hard drive attached directly to your computer and you want to store the information in the datafile in data structure known as a **_dataframe_**, then the easiest way to read the datafile is using the `read_csv()` function that comes with the `pandas` library.

    "### Example 1: Read a Datafile and Create a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the details of hypothesis testing, we first need to read a datafile and store its information in a data structure called a **_DataFrame_**. DataFrames are part of a software package called `Pandas`. Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures (e.g DataFrames) and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. \n",
    "\n",
    "A _DataFrame_ is very similar to a Microsoft(C) Excel spreadsheet with columns and rows. In both an Excel spreadsheet and DataFrame, the rows hold the data values for each subject (or object) in the dataset while the columns contain values for different variables associated with each subject. These data values can be either strings (letters) or numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the experimental data is contained in a textfile called \"BodyData.txt\". In order to read this data using the `pandas` function `read_csv()` we need to provide the function with two _arguments_:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **_filepath_** to the datafile.\n",
    "2. The text character used in the datafile to **_separate_** data values. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things easier, the **_filepath_** in this example is simply the name of the datafile, including its file extension, `BodyData.text`. You only need to provide the filename **IF** the file is located in the current working directory. If the datafile is **not** in your current working directory, then the _filepath_ must include the names of all of the directories and subdirectories as well as the filename. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing you need to tell the function is the text character used to **separate** data values. The name of this argument is `sep` which stands for _separator_. The most common separators are commas, tabs and spaces. In the example below, data values are separted by a space, so the separator argument `sep` is set to equal a space `sep = \" \"`. (NOTICE: There is eactly one space between the double quotes). \n",
    "\n",
    "As it typical of many Python packages, we gave the`pandas` package a \"nickname\" when we imported the package. If you look at the list of packages imported at the beginning of this program, you will see the line: `import pandas as pd`. The `as pd` means that we don't have to write out the entire word `pandas` when calling the function, just its abbreviation `pd`. While this saves us from writing only a couple of letters of code, Python strives to be efficient as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we assign a variable to function which will be the name of the **_dataframe_** the function will create for us. In this example, the dataframe will be called `BodyData_df`. We will use the suffix `_df` as a reminder that this variable is a `pandas` dataframe."

As always, the null hypothesis, _H<sub>0</sub>_: is that there is _nothing interesting going on_. In other words, the average or mean amout of Tetrahydrocortisone secretion in a 24-hr period is roughly the same for all four tumor types. Since we are testing the data between 4 different tumor types, we need to use an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  \n",
