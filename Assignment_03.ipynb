    "### The Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of computer languages, _complied_ and _interpreted_. Compiled languages include FORTAN and C, while interpreted languages include Python, R, and BASIC. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Complied Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "When programming in a compiled language, you start by writing a _source file_. When you have finished, the source file is processed by a computer program called a _compiler_. The compiler's first step is to _pre-process_ the source code and report any coding errors. Once all the errors has been fixed, the compiler's next step is to produce an _intermediate compiled output file_ containing assembly-level instructions. This intermediate file is then processed by the compiler's _assembler_ to generate **machine code**. Finally, the compiler's _linker_ links all the function calls with their definitions, and adds some extra code to indicate when the program starts and stops. Your source file is finally an **_executable file_** that you call run on your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these intermediate steps--between writing your code and running it--learning how to program  a complied language is slower than learning how to program an interpreted language. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Interpreted Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted computer languages, like Python, do **not** need to be compiled before they can be executed. Instead, a computer program called the **Python Interpreter** reads one line of code at a time. If there are no errors, the Python interpreter immediately executes the code, and then reads the next line of code, executes it, and so forth until it finishes the last line. \n",
    "Since there are no intermediate steps, learning to program an interpreted computer language is faster since you get immediate \"feedback\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, many students who take STA1403 find programming to be kind of enjoyable. The Python language has a reputation of being the easiest and most fun to learn of all the modern programming languages (e.g Java, JavaScript, C++, C#). \n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly [Guido van Rossum](https://pythoninstitute.org/about-python#:~:text=Python%20was%20created%20by%20Guido,called%20Monty%20Python's%20Flying%20Circus) had a had a sense of humor when he created Python. He named his new language, not after the snake, but in honor of the cult British comedy show [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus).\n",

    "## Basic Python Elements \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language code has several different types of **_elements_**. Learning to identify the different elements and and how to use them is an important and necessary step to becoming a Python programmer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1** contained three of the most basic elements in the Python language: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comments\n",
    "2. Strings\n",
    "3. Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line in **Exercise 1** was:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Insert your code for Exercise 1 here`\n",
    "\n",
    "That line of code is a **_comment_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though _comments_ are not run (executed) by the Python Interpreter, they are extremely important. Whenever Python \"sees\" the hashtag symbol `#`, it **ignores** everything _after_ it until the next line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are included in computer code to explain to **_you_**, not Python, what's going on. When you are writing code, you know what is going on. However, if you go back and look at your code sometime later, it might not be so clear what you wanted the code to do or why you wrote it a certain way. By adding comments you help yourself (as well as anyone else reading your code) understand what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, you don't have to limit your comments to a separate line. You can also add a comment at the end of a code line. Consider, for example, the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# Insert your code for Exercise 1 here    `<br>\n",
    "`print(\"Hello World\")  # Kernighan's example  `\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the print function is followed by the comment `# Kernighan's example`. The comment helps to explain to your, but not to the Python Interpreter, why that particular string was being printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, comments will be placed liberally within the code to help you understand the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What the code is trying to accomplished.\n",
    "2. What arguments and their values are being passed to a function.\n",
    "3. Why was the code written this way instead of another way. \n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature of the Jupyter Lab notebook, is that it automatically displays comments using a green font. So if you see text written in green, you know that Python Interpreter will ignore it but you should pay attention to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to **Exercise 1**, inside the parentheses were the words **Hello World** enclosed in double quotation marks `(\"Hello World\")`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever Python sees _characters_ (letters, numbers, punctuation marks) enclosed within quotation marks, Python treats them as a literal string constant, or more succinctly, a **_string_**. Strings are an especially important element type in the Python language, and Python has a very rich set of \"tools\" (methods) for string manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quotation Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses both single (') and double (\") quotes interchangeably to denote literal string constants. The general convention is that double quotes should enclose actual text, such as words or sentences while single quotes should enclose symbolic text, such as error codes. In some instances, it is necesary to use both types of quotation marks within the same sentence, as will shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** are the _commands_ that perform some action. Python functions are always followed by parentheses. For example, **Exercise 1** used the Python function `print()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions may, or may not, have **_arguments_**. If a function does **not** have an argument, the parantheses are empty; If the function has one (or more) arguments, the arguments are written inside the parantheses, separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Exercise 1**, the `print()` function had one argument, the string `\"Hello Word\"`. In ComputerSpeak you would say that \"The code  _passed_ one argument to the print function\". "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are essentially _labels_ that are assigned to Python objects such as a string. Example 2 below, uses the variable, `msg`, as a label for the string \"Hello World\". In ComputerSpeak, you say that \"you _assign_ a value to a variable\". The equal sign `=` is used to make an assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing the string \"Hello World\" to the print function, you can just pass the variable `msg`, since from Python's perspective, a variable is the same as the thing as the object it represents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the string in this example is pretty short, you might not see any big advantage to using a variable instead of the string itself. After all, assigning a string to a variable is just more code to write. \n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose our string was much longer, such as the URL to a website with a dataset about the frequency of shark attacks:\n",

    "https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?titleType=dataset-downloads&showDatasetDownloadSkip=False&messageId=datasetsWelcome&returnUrl=%2Fdatasets%2Fthedevastator%2Fglobal-shark-attack-incidents%2Fversions%2F2%3Fresource%3Ddownload\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use the URL in more than once, it makes sense to assign it to a short variable like `shark_data`. \n",

For example, either `total_neurons` or `TotalNeurons` would be good variable names, while the name `Total Neurons`, with a space between the words, would generate an error.\n",
    "* Variable names should be both short and descriptive. For example, the name `total_neurons` is better (more descriptive) than just `tn`. It is also better (shorter) than `total_number_of_neurons_in_the_model`. \n",
    "* Try to avoid using the lowercase letter _l_ and the uppercase letter _O_ since they are easily confused with the number _1_ and the number _0_.\n",

Many modern computer languages such as C use zero-based numbering, but not all of them. For example the statistical computing language R starts numbering arrays at 1 which certainly makes it easier for first-time programmers to learn. And some languages like Pascal, Lua and Visual Basic allow the programmer to set the index origin number to either 0 or 1 within their code.\n",
