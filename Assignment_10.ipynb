    "# Introduction to Cluster Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Cluster analysis_** is a data analysis technique that explores the naturally occurring groups within a data set known as **_clusters_**. Cluster analysis doesn't need to group data points into any predefined groups, which means that it is an **_unsupervised_** learning method. Like regression analysis, cluster analysis is considered a form of **_Machine Learning_** that is one of the main componenets of **_Artificial Intelligence_** or **_AI_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "![__](AI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main forms of Cluster Analysis is **_K-Means Cluster Analysis_** and **_Hierachial Cluster Analysis_**. _K_-means clustering is the most commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithm for partitioning a given data set into a set of **_K_** groups (i.e. $k$ clusters), where **_K_** represents the number of groups pre-specified by the analyst. It classifies objects in multiple groups (i.e., _clusters_), such that objects within the same cluster are as similar as possible (i.e., high intra-class similarity), whereas objects from different clusters are as dissimilar as possible (i.e., low inter-class similarity). In _K_-Means clustering, each cluster is represented by its center (i.e, centroid) which corresponds to the mean of points assigned to the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two potential problems with the K-means clustering algorithm. First, it is a flat clustering method. After observations are assigned to their clusters, they are all considered to be similar within the same cluster. That is, the observations are not further separated based on dissimilarity within a cluster. Secondly, we need to specify the number of clusters K _a priori_. Finding the appropriate number of clusters is not trivial, and the selected number has a substantial impact on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach that avoids these issues is **hierarchical clustering**. The result of this method is a dendrogram (a tree). The root of the dendrogram is its highest level and contains all _n_ observations. The leaves of the tree are its lowest level and are each a unique observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, the cluster analysis approach is introducted by using K-Means Cluster analyis to classify three species of the iris flowers based on their petal and sepal lengths. In a future lesson we look at an example of hiearchical cluster analysis."

(NOTE: A PDF of this paper has been included with this lesson). It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

    "# K-Means Cluster Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, a _cluster_ refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities. For example, _Iris_ flowers fron the same species might be expected to form a cluster if each species has relatively unique combination of petal and sepal lengths and widths. In this lesson, we will use K-Means Cluster Analysis to see if _Iris_ flowers form distinct clusters based on their sepal lengths (`sepalLen`) and sepal widths (`sepalWid`). As an exercise, your will perform K-Means Cluster analysis on the breast cancer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to  \"plot the data\" in an _n-dimensional_ space. For the _Iris_ data we can plot the data on a standard XY scatterplot since we will only be using 2 independent variables at a time. In the _Examples_, we will be using _sepal length_, which we plot along the X-axis and _sepal width_, which we will plot along the Y-axis. In the **_Exercises_** you will be using _petal length_ and _petal width_. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Centroids\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the independent variables has been plotted in their _n-dimensional_ space, your computer will randomly place a small number of imaginary \"objects\" called _centroids_ somewhere within the data. How many _centroids_ will be placed is up to you. The number of centroids is called **_K_**, which explains, in part, the name **_K_**-_Means Cluster_ analysis. For the _Iris_ flower data, we will be using 3 centroids (_K_=3) since we will be looking for 3 data clusters, one for each flower species. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How the _K_-Means Cluster algorithm works\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your computer has randomly placed the _K_ centroids within the data points, it calculates how far each data point is from the each centroid. Data points that are closest to a particular centroid are assigned to that centroid to form a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the centroids were placed randomly, it very unlikely that they ended up being in the true center of a particular cluster. This is where the \"Machine Learning\" comes in. Your computer then performs a series of \"loops\" (_iterations_) in which it starts _learning about the data_. During each iteration, it moves the location of all the centroids and computes whether the new locations are \"better\" than the old location. The computer keeps moving the centroids around until their locations are as optimal as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For you to make these calculation manually would take a considerable amount of time and effort. However, these are _exactly_ the kind of small repetitive computations that your laptop is supremely good at, and can perform at blazing speeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will be asking your computer to make up to 300 iterations. In other words, your computer will repeat the _K_-means Cluster computational procedure over and over, up to 300 times. How many iternations--or how long do you want to wait for an answer--is up to you. You can set the number of iterations using the argument, `maxiter = `. Each time, the algorithmn runs, it uses the results of the last run to improve its seach. After every run, your computer will (hopefully) get closer (better) approximations to the solution of the problem, such as separating all 150 plants in the Iris flower dataset into 3 clusters, one for each species.        \n",
    "To make the algoithmn run faster, the _K_-Means Cluster software is smart enough to know when the locations of thecentroids have stabilized and there is no change in their values. At this point the \"looping\" will stop and the results will be printed out. However, if some data has not separated into clusters, the program terminates when the number of maximum iterations has been reached. "

    "## Estimating _K_ using an _Elbow Plot_\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major challenges when using _K_-Means analysis is deciding on the number of clusters the algorithmn should be looking for? With the _Iris_ data, we already know to look for 3 clusters -- one for each plant species. But in most cases we won't know the correct number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a widely accepted technique called the _Elbow Method_ that gives an estimate for _K_. In the Elbow Method, the data is analyzed using a small range (e.g. 1 to 10) of _K_ values. For each _K_ value, the **WCSS** (Within-Cluster Sum of Square) value is computed. The _WCSS_ is the sum of the squared distance between each data point and the centroid in a cluster. The lower the WCSS, the \"better\" the fit between the centroids and the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is always easier to fit data with more and more parameters. So as the _K_ value increases, the WCSS value will _always_ get smaller and smaller. However, plotting the WCSS as a function the _K_ value, usually produces a line with a shape similar to an _elbow_. As the number of clusters increases from 1, to 2, to 3, on so on, the WCSS value initally starts to decrease rapidly, but at some value of _K_, the rate of decline suddenly slows. The _K_ value where this _elbow_-shape lines slows is either the optimal number of clusters, or very close to it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code in the cell below generates a line plot (i.e. _Elbow plot_) of the WCSS for _K_ values from 1 to 10 for the sepal dimensions using the function `fviz_nbclust()`. This function that is part of the `factoextra` library that was installed before the lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `fviz_nbclust()` function requires the data to be in the form of a numerical _matrix_, not a dataframe. Therefore, before we can generate our elbow plot, we will first need to convert the sepal dimensions in `iris_df` into a numerical matrix called `sep_mat` using the `data.matrix()` function as shown in Example 3."

    "\n",
    "We are now ready to generate an XY scatterplot in which the X-value for each point is the sepal length of a particular flower and the point's Y-value is the flower's sepal width. Since we have already separated the XY sepal dimensions by **_species_** in Example 10, it is simple to plot these sepal dimensions using different colors for the three different Iris species. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several graphics packages for R that could be used to generate these XY scatterplots--the most sophisticated (\"complex\") being a package called `ggplot2`. Instead we will use what is called _base graphics_ that comes embedded in the R language. \n",

    "The data points in this plot will be colored green. The argument`ylim` is used to set the Y-limits of the plot to the values between 1.5 and 5 while the argument `xlim` sets the X-limits between 4 and 8.5. These values must be adjusted _manually_ to center the data points in the center of the graph. The argument `main` sets the main title of the graph which `xlab` sets the label for the X-axis and `ylab` sets the label for Y-axis. \n",

    "After initial XY plot of _Iris setosa_ sepal data, we _add_ the data points for _Iris versicolor_, _Iris virginica_, and the 3 cluster centroids using the function called `points()`.
